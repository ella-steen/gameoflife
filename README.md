# gameoflife
Game of Life Project
Created by Ella Steen and Sharon Patta

This program initializes a board, in which can live 'organisms' (represented by *). An organism is generated originally by user input, which specifies how many, their locations, and how many generations of organisms the game should cycle through. An organism will live if it has 2 or 3 neighbors, but will die if it has fewer than 2 or greater than 3 neighbors. If there is an empty cell with exactly three neighbors, a new organism will 'gestate' and be born there.
